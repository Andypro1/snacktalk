ytalk (3.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Droping X support. It got nearly unusable and this will prepare the
    users for the drop of the upstream support. (Closes: #190435)
  * Added a fix from upstream to enable connections to users having
    usernames longer than 8 characters. (Closes: #113644)

    available.

ytalk (3.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Security fix:
    It turns out it was possible to write 44 bytes of arbitrary data to YTalk
    memory when running the auto-invite daemon (off by default), due to a
    nasty sprintf() call and a buffer overflow.

    I didn't really investigate how much nastiness you might be able to
    accomplish with these 44 bytes, but I did confirm that YTalk can be
    crashed by anyone who knows the auto-invite daemon's TCP port number.
