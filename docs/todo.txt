High priority

Faux 256 color support:
	Create stack space (In vt100?  cwinc?  elsewhere?) for a 256 pair LRU queue.  Upon terminals requesting a pair, the program will search through the queue for a matching pair, or a pair that will match when inversed.  It will return the match.  If a pair is not found, it is pushed into the queue, defined with init_pair(), and returned.

	A full queue will destroy the least recently used pair when more than 256 have been allocated.

	use lru cache from http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-lru-cache/

	Change ReferencePage() to return the pageNumber which will be the COLOR_PAIR number.

	Change QNode struct to include the fgcolor and bgcolor int values, and then change the search function to look for the color combination.	

Low priority - this stuff won't happen.  snacktalk vNext will be created in .NET to facilitate these items
Implement full Unicode support.  probably start by replacing all chars with W_CHAR or whatever type of thing, etc.  or sth.
After it's ready, switch all users to en_US.UTF-8 - see locale -a
