			Installation Procedure for Snacktalk


0) Preparation

To build and install Snacktalk, you need to unpack the archive.  Since you're
reading this text, you have presumabley already done that.  Snacktalk uses
GNU autoconf now for configuration; those of you familiar with compiling
GNU utilities will feel quite at home.

Short & sweet:

	./configure
	make
	make install

1) Configuration

To configure Snacktalk, run the `configure' script provided with the
distribution.  You may use all the standard arguments configure scripts
take.  The most important ones are:

  --help                  print help message

  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                          (/usr/local by default)
  --bindir=DIR            user executables in DIR (PREFIX/bin)
  --mandir=DIR            man documentation in DIR [PREFIX/man]

  --with-curses=DIR       specify where to find curses

  --enable-debug          compile in memory tracking and debug messages


The `./configure' script also understands a number of environment variables:

  CPPFLAGS   flags to give to CPP and CC.
	     ex: CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/some/include/dir ./configure

  LIBS       extra libraries to link to, and/or where to find them.
	     ex: LIBS="-L/path/to/extra/libs -R/path/to/extra/libs" ./configure

  CFLAGS     flags to give when compiling (default is -g -O2).
	     ex: CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure

  LDFLAGS    extra flags to give when linking.
	     ex: LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

You can customize many default settings by editing Makefile and
config.h.  The program will work very well without your touching these
files, but it is useful to have a look at things you can change there.

2) Compilation

To compile the program, type make and cross your fingers.  Snacktalk is
fairly portable, so this _should_ work out of the box.  If it doesn't,
please mail the maintainers using the contact information listed at the
website above.

After the compilation, a ready to use `snacktalk' executable should reside
in the distribution directory.  Other than missing its system-wide
configuration file, it'll be all ready to use.

This is also the right moment to look at the file `snacktalkrc', which will
be installed as the system-wide configuration file.

If you change any options in the Makefile, please run "make clean"
before recompiling.  If you change the environment variables to run
`./configure' again, please delete the file `config.cache'.

3) Installation

Use `make install' to install Snacktalk to the directories specified to
configure (/usr/local/* by default).

The standard installation process will copy the Snacktalk binary to
/usr/local/bin, the man page to /usr/local/man/man1, and the system
snacktalkrc to /usr/local/etc.  You can customize the directories either
through the configuration process or making the necessary changes in the
Makefile.

To delete the files created by Snacktalk installation, you can use make
uninstall.

4) Acknowledgements

YTalk was maintained by Andreas Kling from version 3.1.3 to version 
3.3.0. At the time of this writing, YTalk development has become very
fractured, with no obvious single development source. Most websites
which did exist (and are still linked to as a 'current' maintainer) are
now offline. Overall, YTalk itself appears pretty dead. Thus, we have
taken over 'development' in much the same way R. Llima and A. Kling
did... we will be integrating any bug fixes we develop or that are given
to us and implementing some pretty simple features.

The AUTHORS file gives a much more complete list of people who have 
contributed to this application through the years, and the ChangeLog 
file gives a pretty detailed list of who did what when.
